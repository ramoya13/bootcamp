## 5. What is the value of j after each of the following code fragments is executed?  

a.	j = 0  
	for i in range (0, 10) :  
	j += i  

1


b.	j = 1  
	for i in range (0, 10) :  
	j += j  

2


c.	for j in range (0, 10) :  
	j += j  

3
  

## 6. What are m and n after the following code is executed?  

n = 123456789  
m = 0  
while n != 0:  
	m = (10 * m) + (n % 10)  
	n //= 10  
	print (m)  
	print (n)  

m=o


## 7 What does this code do?
f = 0  
g = 1  
for i in range (0, 10):  
	f = f + g  
	g = f - g  
	print (f)  



## Bonus: Is there an example for when the following for and while loops are not equivalent?  
for variable in range(start, stop):  
				statement1  
				statement2  
				...  
  
  
variable = start  
while variable < stop:  
		statement1  
		statement2  
		...  
		variable +=1
